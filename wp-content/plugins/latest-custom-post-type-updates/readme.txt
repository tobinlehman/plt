Simple widgetized display of the latest posts in your custom post type. Also allows for easy filtered display of regular posts in a widget.

== Description ==
= Simplicity at its finest! =
This simple plugin adds a widget that allows for the display of recent posts in any custom post type. It functions almost identically to the built-in WordPress "Recent Posts" widget with the added option of letting you choose which post type it pulls from. Just add the "Latest Custom Post Type" widget to a widget area, give it a title, how many posts to show and what post type you want it to pull from. It's that easy!

= Advanced Options =
While this plugin allows for quick and easy use, there are also LOADS of advanced features that site owners, designers, and developers will all enjoy.

* Change how the posts are pulled (e.g. Publish date, modified date, meta keys)
* Change how they are displayed (e.g. Pull by modified date, but show in alphabetical order)
* Define custom text for when there are no posts to show (defaults to showing nothing)
* Define custom CSS classes
* Show post thumbnails with the option of a default thumbnail image and custom size
* Show the post date/time or post modified date/time and specify the format
* Show post excerpts, specifying the length and read more link text
* Restrict posts by taxonomy and taxonomy terms

Fanciest Author Box
===================

The only author box plugin you'll ever need.

Fanciest Author Box is a WordPress plugin developed by ThematoSoup. Its long list of features gives identity to your single or multi-author WordPress blog. Social widgets are a nice asset that let you present authors in a more personal manner and are ideal for guest bloggers.

This premium author bio plugin is very easy to use and customize. Right after installation the author bio is, by default, enabled on all your posts, pages and custom post types. You can also implement it as a widget in your sidebars, as a template tag or manually using shortcode. It is translation ready and uses color pickers which allow you to set your own color scheme.
